2021-05-04 14:23:47> WARNING: No Bruker libraries are available for this operating system. Intensities are uncalibrated, resulting in (very) small differences. However, mobility and m/z values need to be estimated. While this estimation often returns acceptable results with errors < 0.02 Th, huge errors (e.g. offsets of 6 Th) have already been observed for some samples!
